				<h2>Project Farmlend</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>The Farmlend project started in October 2012, and was introduced by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a problem to be solved. In many regions of the world, farmers lead very difficult lives. Farmers and their livelihood are severely affected by climate factors, weather conditions, and volatile market trends. In addition, many of them lack access to state-of-the-art technologies and the latest scientific research that can significantly improve their farm productivity.

<br><br>
Nonetheless, for many countries in these regions, agriculture constitutes a fundamental part of the economy. The fact of the matter is that there are talented and capable farmers out there in these regions, who need financial help in kickstarting or growing their farms. However, the lack of an effective system to assess the credit-worthiness of farmers have led to micro-loans being unsystematically granted. This resulted in high default rates, and growing awareness in the micro-lending community of the need to develop a robust system to tackle this problem.
<br><br>
The goal of Farmlend is essentially to create a mobile app and a web platform of such a credit-worthiness assessment tool. The Farmlend tool will have to be robust enough to return accurate and timely results, and also be flexible to different environments and countries in the world.</p>
